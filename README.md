Module 9 Challenge

I am the new Data Engineer at Pewlett Hackard and I have been tasked to do a research project about people that were employeed by the company during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the files into a SQL database and answered questions about the data. To do this, I performed data modeling, data engineering, AND data analysis.

I created an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using QuickDBD.

I then created a table schema for each CSV file and imported the data into its corresponding SQL table.

I then performed a data analysis answering several questions regarding the employee data.
